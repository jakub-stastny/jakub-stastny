I'm a semi-retired software developer, blogger, [illustrator](https://www.instagram.com/jakub.stastny.pt) and gardener. Let's talk life?

# My tools of choice

- Elm for the web, Common Lisp or Haskell for anything else.
- Emacs in EVIL mode.
- Org mode for everything, including code (literate programming).
- iPad Pro 11", Blink, Mosh & ZSH. Ubuntu VPS.
- Scriptable for writing iPadOS widgets.
- Apple Pencil & Procreate for illustrations.

  As of now there's no way of contacting me. (Well, maybe Twitter.) Disabling the following for now:

# Available for hire?

Potentially. If you have an interesting project you think I'd like, drop me a line.

Just keep in mind that:

- I live in Mexico and I'm not interested in relocation.
- I'm not interested in a job. Project, maybe. Job, no.

# Available for colaboration?

If you have a cool project and are looking for colaborators, I might be open to it â€“ especially if it's something for iPadOS, which is where a lot of my interest lies these days.
