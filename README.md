I'm a semi-retired software developer, currently working more often as an [energy healer](https://jakubstastny.guide/about). I like to cook and draw. Let's talk life?

I'm based in Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½. During my days I had the good fortune of living in Prague, London, Barcelona and Warsaw, not to mention extensive travelling. These days I prefer gardening.

# My tools of choice

- Clojure, Babashka, socket (p)REPL.
- Emacs in EVIL mode & inf-clojure.
- Org mode for everything, including code (literate programming).
- iPad Pro 11", Blink, Mosh & ZSH. Ubuntu VPS.
- Apple Pencil & Procreate for illustrations.

## Here is how I like to work:

Literate programming in Org mode, yes please!
