I'm a software developer, blogger, [illustrator](https://www.instagram.com/jakub.stastny.pt) and gardener. Let's talk life ?

# My tools of choice

- TypeScript
- Emacs with EVIL mode or iVim on iPad.
- Org mode
- ZSH
- iPad Pro
- Blink & Mosh.
- Ubuntu VPS on DigitalOcean
- Git
- Swift & SwiftUI.
- Apple Pencil & Procreate for illustrations.

# Available for hire?

Potentially. If you have an interesting project you think I'd like, drop me a line.

Just keep in mind that:

- I live in Mexico and I'm not interested in relocation.
- I'm not interested in a job. Project, maybe. Job, no.

# Available for colaboration?

If you have a cool project and are looking for colaborators, I might be open to it â€“ especially if it's something for iPadOS, which is where a lot of my interest lies these days.
