I'm a semi-retired software developer, energy healer and gardener. I like to cook and draw. Let's talk life?

I used to work with OOP, mutable data and a lot of weird shit happening (Ruby on Rails). Then I switched to Clojure and I'm much happier.

# My tools of choice

- Clojure, Babashka, socket (p)REPL.
- Emacs in EVIL mode & inf-clojure.
- Org mode for everything, including code (literate programming).
- iPad Pro 11", Blink, Mosh & ZSH. Ubuntu VPS.
- Apple Pencil & Procreate for illustrations.

## Here is how I like to work:

Literate programming in Org mode, yes please!
